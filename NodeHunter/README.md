This project is called NodeHunter, it generates a grid and the grid generates a user inputted amount of nodes.
Each node has the data: Position, Color, and ID. The user guesses the position of nodes from position 1 through 25.
Each time step each node that has been caught by the users guess changes color to red and can no longer be caught, and
data is tracked including how many have been caught and how many remain. After all nodes have been caught the program will conclude.
